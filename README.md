# Task List in React

Simple task list moved from vanilla JS into React.js 
The app now does not have the functionality added. Soon it will be possible use the buttons to: 
- add tasks
- mark tasks as done
- remove tasks from the list
- mark all tasks as done
- hide finished tasks.

If any task is entered into the list, two buttons appear: to mark all tasks as done, and to hide all tasks marked as done. 
If all tasks are marked as complete, the mark all button is disabled.

Project done as a part of front-end development course at YouCode.
