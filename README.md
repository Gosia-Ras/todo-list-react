# &#128221; Task List in React

Simple task created using React. Previously coded in JavaScript. 

 &#128311; The app consists of three main blocks: 
* Task List where you can:
  - add tasks yourself or fetch example tasks
  - mark one or all tasks as done &#9989;
  - remove tasks from the list
  - hide finished tasks
  - display how many tasks need to be completed
  - filter tasks using the search bar &#128269;
* Task Page that can be viewed when clicking on task name: 
  - it displays the name of the task, completion state and ID number on the list
* Author Page where you can read my short introduction
  

Tasks input into the task list are stored using local storage.

Project done as a part of front-end development course at YouCode.
