# &#128221; Task List in React

Simple task created using React. Previously coded in JavaScript. 

 &#128311; The app consists of three main blocks: 
* Task List where you can:
  - add tasks yourself or fetch example tasks
  - mark one or all tasks as done &#9989;
  - remove tasks from the list
  - hide finished tasks
  - display how many tasks need to be completed
  - filter tasks using the search bar &#128269;
* Task Page that can be viewed when clicking on task name: 
  - it displays the name of the task, completion state and ID number on the list
* Author Page where you can read my short introduction
  

Tasks input into the task list are stored using local storage.

Project done as a part of front-end development course at YouCode.

### Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
